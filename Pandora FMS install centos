**Setting up monitoring**

Click resources -> add agents
on this page click create agent in the bottom right
put in the name and the pi address of the system, you can also choose the os
click create in the bottom right
you should now be in the setup view with information about the agent and a qr code on the right of the screen

Now its time to make some modules
click on the modules tab in the top right (looks like a computer monitor with a heartbeat)
on this page click the dropdown for "type" and choose "new network server module"
click create
in this case I am creating a module to check if the host is alive, this is done through icmp
in the module component dropdown choose "network management"
then in the new dropdown that says "manual setup" choose "host alive"
cange the name if you choose and change the module group if you want
now leave the rest as the default values, ensure that target ip is set to the remote system
click create in the bottom right
now the status should say not initialized with a blue box
in the top right click the view tab (look like an eye)
this shows an overview of the agent and its modules
if the host alive is still not initialized click the force remote checks button in the top right of the agent contact area
upon refreshing the module should be working and should say it is normal.
repeat for any other agents that you have setup.


**setting up snmp monitoring**
the remote system you want to monitor with snmp must already have it installed and initialised (we did this in the network management lab)

once you have snmp setup on the remote system go to pandora, click monitoring, go to snmp then snmp browser
set the target ip to the ip of the remote system and the community to whatever you named your snmp community
set the starting OID to .1.3.6.1.2
set the version to v.2c
click browse
if noting happens then your snmp is not setup on the remote host or you input the incorrect information
if it worked a tree list will show up
to setup disk monitoring expand hots resources and then find storage description and storage used
click the magnifying glass next to each one in the description dropdown and in the value place it will say what it is
to monitor the system hard drive find the one named "/"
once you have found that remeber what number it was
find that same number in the storage used section and click the magnifying glass
then in the OID information window click the create network component button
name it whatever name you would like then click the group dropdown and choose *network management* (important)
scroll down to find the port option and put in 161
click create in the bottom right
go back to manage agents and choose the one that you just made the disk monitor for
go to the modules tab change the type to create a new network server module
click create in the module cick the first "manual setup" dropdown and choose network management
then in the dropdown on the right next to it choose storage used or whatever you named the network component
then click create in the bottom right
in the view tab click the force remote check a couple of times and refresh until the counter resets
after refreshing and force checking the storage used module should show that it is normal and show a number
repete this process on other hosts you would like to monitor with snmp
