**Setting up monitoring**

Click resources -> add agents
on this page click create agent in the bottom right
put in the name and the pi address of the system, you can also choose the os
click create in the bottom right
you should now be in the setup view with information about the agent and a qr code on the right of the screen

Now its time to make some modules
click on the modules tab in the top right (looks like a computer monitor with a heartbeat)
on this page click the dropdown for "type" and choose "new network server module"
click create
in this case I am creating a module to check if the host is alive, this is done through icmp
in the module component dropdown choose "network management"
then in the new dropdown that says "manual setup" choose "host alive"
cange the name if you choose and change the module group if you want
now leave the rest as the default values, ensure that target ip is set to the remote system
click create in the bottom right
now the status should say not initialized with a blue box
in the top right click the view tab (look like an eye)
this shows an overview of the agent and its modules
if the host alive is still not initialized click the force remote checks button in the top right of the agent contact area
upon refreshing the module should be working and should say it is normal.
repeat for any other agents that you have setup.
