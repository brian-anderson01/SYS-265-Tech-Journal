**Make sure that vms are on the lan**

on web01 set up network and change host name
create sudo user named brian
add dns records for web01

enable snmp on the firewall https://www.rmtechteam.com/wiki/tech-wiki/rmtt/product-specific/pfsense-enable-snmp/
restart bsnmpd in the status dropdown then services

boot up nmon01 and setup network and hostname
add dns records for nmon01 on ad
make a sudo user and disable root ssh in etc/ssh/sshd_config
putty in from mgmt01 and yum install net-snmp-utils

On web01 yum install net-snmp-utils net-snmp
cd /etc/snmp/ and move the conf file and create a new one
input the new config lines
enable and start snmpd
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=161/udp
firewall-cmd --reload

install and configure snmp on ad01
https://newhelptech.wordpress.com/2019/02/09/how-to-enabling-and-configuring-snmp-services-on-windows-server-2019/
install snmp tools on mgmt01

Enable remote managemnt on ad01
go to server manager right click ad01 and choose computer management click ok on error
enable remote powershell on ad01 https://www.faqforge.com/windows/create-powershell-session-remote-computer/
once you have configured it so mgmt01 is a tusted host open powershell on mgmt01
execute 
Enter-PSSession -Credential Get-Credential -ComputerName ad01-brian
in the session execute Set-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup "Remote Event Log Management" -Enable True
remote computer management from server manager should work now

in computer management go to services then find the snmp service, go to properties
add SYS265 to community names add nmon01-brian to the hosts to accept snmp packets from
Restart the service

on web01 run sudo tcpdump -i ens192 port 161 -c10 -AAA
then on nmon01 run snmpwalk -Os -c SYS265 -v2c web01-brian system
In the tcpdump on web01 you should be able to see the SYS265 in clear text which is supposed to act like a password

I would like to learn more about snmp, powershell and remote management using server manager
